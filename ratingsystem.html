         <i><h1>- Combining OSERS Ratings:</h1></i><br>
         <h1>[AA] All Ages</h1>
         <h2>Ages: 0 to 199 years</h2>
         <p>[AA] along with [E] can combine with the five main OSERS ratings to create a more specific rating. For example, a language course may be rated [AAE] due to it being education that all ages can learn. [AAE] is All Ages Education.</p>
   
   
         <h1>[E] Education</h1>
         <h2>Ages: 0 to 199 years</h2>
         <p>[E] like [AA], can combine with ratings for a more tailored rating. For example, a schoolhouse may assign an online activity for the students to do at home, that online assignment may receive the [KE] rating, for Child [K] Education [E].</p>
       
   
      


      <h1 class="dividingBorderAbove">Additional Information</h1>
      <p><b>(Loose) Definitions:</b> Our Neutral Rating is 'neutral' in terms of being in between Kids [K] and Warmtemp [W]. The Warmtemp rating (formerly Teen [T]) has its name because if 'Hottemp' was Mature - due to the nature of content with [M], [W] is warm when in comparison to [M].</p>
