          <h1>Home</h1>
          <p>The initial idea behind OSERS was to be a private in-house rating standard for a variety of projects ranging from video games and anime to movies and tv-shows. 
            That idea was scrapped when it was realized that OSERS could be publicized to act as a primary rating system for open source software, alongside being a solid rating standard for entertainment related purposes and activities, including but not limited to things like anime, 
            cartoons, comics, documentaries, movies, video games, and more.
          </p>

          <p>The OSERS Rating System is fully explained in the "Rating System" tab on the navigation bar. There is also short tests available in the "Receive Rating" tab to easily obtain an OSERS rating for a game or product. Displaying OSERS assets on a product is easy. Simply make sure the product follows the specific rules and guidelines to the respective rating.</p>

          <p>What is the purpose behind OSERS? OSERS exists for people who want their products recognizably rated, easily. Accurately self-rate the product using our rating guide or use our rating test to label the product accordingly. This way, the end-user can easily type in the OSERS rating online to see what the product could entail. Without OSERS, the product would likely go unrated, and the end-user would have no rating reference.
             OSERS was also made for open source games and products that are made available without a traditional storefront.</p>

          <p>Is OSERS trying to compete with something like ESRB? No, OSERS and ESRB have two completely different use cases. A developer should always use an IARC (International Age Rating Coalition) member to rate their game, like ESRB in the United States, or PEGI in Europe, if they are publishing to a traditional storefront. Typically, receiving an IARC rating is required by traditional storefronts. OSERS is for developers who
            are publishing their game or product to something like a personal website. Because they are not using a storefront, receiving an IARC rating could be a headache, or even impossible. Instead, developers can easily use legitimate OSERS ratings.
